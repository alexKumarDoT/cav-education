# Connected and Automated education (CAVe) - in - a -Box

Connected and Automated Vehicle education (CAVe)-in-a-box is an educational tool developed under the FHWA Workforce Development (WFD) project. CAVe-in-a-box is an interconnected set of ITS equipment that was developed to serve as training and educational resources for the emerging ITS workforce.
CAVe-in-a-box represents an ITS environment into a scaled-down portable kit. The kit can be installed at any location which can emulate an intesection where a traffic signals could be implemented, making it well-suited for application testing in the classroom for laboratory use, as well as real world deployment. The kit contains two major components as described below: a mobile kit, representing the vehicle, and an infrastructure kit, representing the environment of a CAV system:
